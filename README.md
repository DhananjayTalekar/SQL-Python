## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing real-world datasets using SQL queries and visualizing the results. The analysis is performed using SQLite, a lightweight database engine, and the `sqlite3` module. The project also leverages SQLite Magic to seamlessly run SQL queries directly within Jupyter notebooks.

### Project Objectives

- **Data Analysis**: Perform various analyses on real-world datasets using SQL queries to extract insights and aggregate data.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize the results of SQL queries to understand data distributions, trends, and relationships.
- **SQLite Magic**: Utilize SQLite Magic to execute SQL commands directly within Jupyter notebooks for an integrated analysis experience.

## Getting Started

To start working with this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DhananjayTalekar/SQL-Python.git
cd SQL-Python
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed. Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up the Environment

1. **Prepare the Data**: Place your datasets in the `data/` directory. Ensure that they are in a format compatible with SQLite (e.g., CSV).

2. **Setup Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Install Jupyter Notebook if you haven't already:

   - Install SQLite Magic for Jupyter Notebook:

     ```bash
     pip install ipython-sql
     ```

   - In your Jupyter Notebook, load the SQLite Magic extension:

     ```python
     %load_ext sql
     ```

3. **Load and Analyze Data**:
   - Create a SQLite database and import your datasets. You can use the provided notebooks to execute SQL queries and visualize results.

### 4. Run the Analysis

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**:
  - Execute SQL queries and visualize the results using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### 5. Review Results

Review the output and visualizations generated in the Jupyter notebooks to understand the data insights and trends.
